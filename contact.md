# Contact

Depending on how well you know me, it might not be that surprising that I don't post on social media all that much, but there are a few places I'm 'active' in

## Discord

Discord is where I'm primarily active because that's sorta just how it works

I'm `toomuchmail` on Discord and can be found hiding in the background of the [TFC](https://discord.gg/PRuAKvY) and [KubeJS](https://discord.gg/fKjDAetj) servers, coming forth when I'm needed or feel like it

These are the primary places where I provide support[^1] for KubeJS TFC, Precision Prospecting, and ConfigJS

And if I ever make a mod that's not tied to those mods I might talk about it in the #showcase channel in the [NeoForge](https://discord.gg/neoforged) server

## Cohost

Calling cohost a "social media" feels wrong, but I don't know the right words

I'm [@Roughly-Enough-Mail](https://cohost.org/Roughly-Enough-Mail?page=0) on cohost and occasionally I'll be salient enough to post something there

You can alos send me an [ask]() there if for some reason you've something to ask of me in public

## GitHub

Wow! The place that hosts this site, no way

Maybe GitHub will fully pivot into being a social media with direct messaging capabilities. When that happens I can be found at [Notenoughmail](https://github.com/Notenoughmail) doing who-knows-what, probably making kube-scritps-that-*really*-oughta-be-mods

## Modrinth & CurseForge

Not really social media, but CF has direct messages so eh

- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/notenoughmail/projects)

Not really useful for contacting me, just felt it a good idea to include
