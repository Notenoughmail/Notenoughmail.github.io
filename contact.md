# Contact

Depending on how well you know me, it might not be that surprising that I don't post on social media all that much, but there are a few places I'm 'active' in

## Discord

Discord is where I'm primarily active because that's sorta just how it works

I'm `toomuchmail` on Discord and can be found hiding in the background of the [TFC](https://discord.gg/PRuAKvY) and [KubeJS](https://discord.gg/fKjDAetj) servers, coming forth when I'm needed or feel like it

These are the primary places where I provide support[^1] for KubeJS TFC, Precision Prospecting, ConfigJS, and TFCGenViewer (as applicable), but I will *always* take bug reports and feature suggestions in a mod's repo

And if I ever make a mod that's not tied to TFC/KubeJS I might talk about it in the *#showcase* channel of the [NeoForge](https://discord.gg/neoforged) server

## cohost

I loved cohost, it was something different and better. And yet, I never did use it to its fullest extent, so I'll leave this here as a keepsake

I was [@Roughly-Enough-Mail](https://cohost.org/Roughly-Enough-Mail) on cohost and occasionally I'd be salient enough to post something there. Those were good days

## GitHub

Wow! The place that hosts this site, no way

Maybe GitHub will fully pivot into being a social media with direct messaging capabilities. When that happens I can be found at [Notenoughmail](https://github.com/Notenoughmail) doing who-knows-what, probably making kube-scripts-that-*really*-oughta-be-mods

## Modrinth & CurseForge

Not really social media, but CF has direct messages so eh

- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/notenoughmail/projects)

Not really useful for contacting me, just felt it a good idea to include
