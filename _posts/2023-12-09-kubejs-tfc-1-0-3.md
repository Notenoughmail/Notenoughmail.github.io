# KubeJS TFC 1.0.3

- Update to TFC 3.1.3-beta
- Remove config option to disable Kube's async recipes (it didn't seem to work anyway)
- Rework how custom food traits are made
- the `tfc:raw_rock` block builder should now not complain about missing mirrored models
- Fix fertilizers adding `phosphorous` instead of `phosphorus`
- Add missing `use_durability` and `chance` parameters to heating recipes
