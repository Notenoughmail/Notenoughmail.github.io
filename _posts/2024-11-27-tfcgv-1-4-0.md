# TFCGenViewer 1.4.0

- Speed up preview generation by caching a region's `Point`s
- Properly deal with errors that may occur during generation
- Add error handling config: can be set to immediately stop preview creation and tell the user or to simply skip the `Point` causing an issue and fill it in with safe, though not accurate, data
- Add progress bar along the bottom of the preview, can be disabled in the config
- Colors and gradients can now be randomized at resource load, see the wiki for how to do so via a resource pack
    - Add an in-built resource pack that randomizes everything
- Convert most color handlers to (`Registered`)`DataManagers`
    - Externally this means little more than most color (gradient) definition files are in different places than before, the new locations will be on the wiki
- Add new grayscale reference gradient
