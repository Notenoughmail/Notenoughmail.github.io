# KubJS TFC 1.2.0

- Fix custom lamps not retaining their fluid when broken
- Register custom blocks with block entities to TFC's own block entities instead of creating a duplicate block entity type
- Custom grass, farmland, and path blocks now use their parent dirt block's texture as their base by default
- Add an event for modifying default worldgen values, including the world's rock layers
    - Change `TFCEvents.rockSettings`'s method from `defineLayer` to `defineRock` to match terminology used here
- Add axle block builder, which has methods for creating corresponding windmills, water wheels, gear boxes, clutches, and bladed axles
- Add encased axle block builder
- Add extremely basic [EntityJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityjs) compat
    - Has `mammal`, `oviparous`, `wooly_animal`, and `dairy_animal` types currently
- Add event for registering a fauna definition to any entity type in the game
- Add methods for getting the fuel, drinkable, fertilizer, lamp fuel, pannable, and sluicable definitions to the misc sub-binding
- Update to TFC 3.2.6 and FirmaLife 2.1.6
- Add recipe handlers for new FL recipe types
- Allow custom windmill blades to specify the texture they use
- Non-wild crops now no longer have an item by default
- Now use Kube's `dev.properties` file instead of a config
    - `debugMode` -> `debugInfo` (default property)
    - Add `tfc/insertSelfTestsIntoConsole` property that will put TFC's self tests into the Kube console if enabled (defaults to true)
