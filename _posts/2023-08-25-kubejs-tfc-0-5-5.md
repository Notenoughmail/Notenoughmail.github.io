This post includes three updates because two of them are no longer available as I have removed them from Modrinth and CurseForge due to the presence of a critical bug

# KubeJS TFC 0.5.3

- Fix delegate recipe types failing to capture in/outputs of json recipes
- Add js events for climate model selection, fire start, prospecting, logging, and animal product events
- rename `rock_settings.register` to `tfc.rock_settings.register`
- Remove deprecated things

# KubeJS TFC 0.5.4

- Add the ability to register custom climate models

# KubeJS TFC 0.5.5

- Fix a problem introduced in 0.5.3
that caused any delegate recipe types with ItemStackProvider outputs to fail
- Add AFC tree tapping recipe type
