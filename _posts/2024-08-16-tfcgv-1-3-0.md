# TFCGenViewer 1.3.0

- The preview screen can now be opened in-world!
    - Also works on servers
    - Can be opened with the `K` key by default
    - Only has options to change the scale since the world settings are already defined
    - Which information a plyer is able to access can be disable/enabled from the server, see below
- Preview generation is now done off-thread, meaning the game should no longer completely lock up on previews that take a long time
    - While generating, a loading icon will be displayed instead of the previous preview, this can be disabled in the client config
    - When generation finishes, the game will ding, this can also be disabled in the client config
- Add a permissions system to limit what players can access via the in-world preview
    - See the [wiki page](/tfcgv/1.20.1/permissions) for an explanation
