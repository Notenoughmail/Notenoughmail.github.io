# KubeJS TFC 1.0.1

Initial 1.20.1 port!

- Requires TFC 3.1.2-beta and KubeJS 2001.6.4-build.95
- Port recipes to new recipe schema system
    - Delegate crafting recipe types no longer accept the same arguments as their base crafting type, now only support a single recipe argument
- Block, item, and fluid(stack) ingredients now use TFC's native classes
- Rework bindings
    - Going forward everything provided by this mod will be accessible through the `TFC` object or, for events` the `TFCEvents` object
- Added JSDoc annotations to everything, meaning ProbeJS should have explanations in its hints
- Split custom spring water healing and particle stuff into its own fluid builder type
- Add common config to automatically turn off async recipes at instance start to prevent problems with TFC's knapping and alloy recipe types
    - **Note**: This does not edit the file and only applies once, reloading KubeJS's common config (i.e. with one of KubeJS's reload commands) will revert the instance back to the setting present in the file
    - This problem should theoretically be resolved in a future TFC release, see my recent chats w/ Alc in the #development channel of TFC's discord
- Add `tfc:hammer` custom item type
- Minimize usage of consumers where possible
- Events
    - Custom rock layers can still be created, but they cannot be added to the world, nor can existing ones be edited or removed anymore
    - Custom climate models now have a callback for the wind vector, callbacks referencing TFC's default implementation can now be accessed
    - Fully remove custom data and worldgen feature creation from Kube's datapack events
- Known (possible) problems/ untested things
    - The autogenerated models for custom javelins may not entirely correct
    - The [wiki](../kubejs_tfc/1.20.1/) does not currently contain some information, but the pages for recipes and data (and worldgen soon hopefully) should be accurate
    - I will work on it when I have the time
    - Moss growing block types are not fully tested
    - Custom fluid containers filled translation component has not been tested
    - TFC's crafting recipe types do not have any way to set the `mirror`, `group`, or `conditions` parameters at this moment
