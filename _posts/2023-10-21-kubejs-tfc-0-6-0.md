# KubeJS TFC 0.6.0

{: .notice }
This update contains major breaking changes

- Add `tfc.collapse` server event
- Events fired on the server (`tfc.climate_model.select`, `tfc.start_fire`, `tfc.prospect`, `tfc.logging`, and `tfc.animal_product`) are now able to be handled in server scripts
- The `tfc.prospect` event now has a method to get its `ProspectResult`
- Add `tfc:tool` item type
    - Has `.hammer()` and `.knife()` methods
- Minimum TFC version is now `2.2.29`
- The `tfc.logging` event now provides a `LevelJS` and `BlockContainerJS`, instead of a raw `LevelAccessor`, `BlockState`, and `BlockPos`
- Data builders in the `server.datapack.*` events now have an optional `ResourceLocation` as a final argument
    - Unfortunately, this means that several once optional arguments are no longer optional
    - For item heat definitions: The forging and welding temps are no longer optional, but nullable
    - For metal definitions: The tier is no longer optional
    - For panning definitions: The model stages are no longer a `String...`, but a `List<String>`, just wrap your model names in square brackets to update
- Add data builders for climate ranges and fauna
- Worldgen builders in `server.datapack.*` events can now specify the namespace of the name (allows overwriting default features), if no colon is found, the namespace will default to `kubejs_tfc` as it did before
- Add the ability to access TFC player data (nutrition, chisel mode, intoxication) through `PlayerJS#getData()`
- Modification and removal of default rock layers now fires as late as possible
