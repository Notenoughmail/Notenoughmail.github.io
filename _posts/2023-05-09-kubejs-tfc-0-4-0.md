# KubeJS TFC 0.4.0

- Add builders for several TFC world gen features
    - Veins
    - Boulders
    - Geodes
    - Thin spikes
    - If-then
- Adds cullfaces to default groundcover models
- add constructors for sluicing and panning data
- Fix some problems with item stack modifiers[^1] sometimes not registering modifiers
- Move food and item data constructors to a better system

[^1]: I think this is supposed to say _item stack **providers**_, but that is truly lost ot time
