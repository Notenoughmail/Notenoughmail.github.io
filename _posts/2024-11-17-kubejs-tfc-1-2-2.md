# KubeJS TFC 1.2.2

- Add Beneath nether fertilizer and lost page builders to the `TFCEvents.data` event if it is installed
- Register the previously missing dispenser behaviors for custom `tfc:fluid_container` items
- Fix the `#withPreExisting` method not working as intended in custom ground cover blocks
- Yet more custom crop fixes (hopefully for the last time)
