# TFCGenViewer 1.4.1

- Add toggleable tooltip when hovering over the preview
- `Color`(`Gradient`)`Definition`s now have the ability to define a key for the tooltip (multiple in the case of gradients)
- *Biomes* and *Rocks* `ColorDefinition`s can now be disabled, preventing them from being added to the color key
- Fix in-world previews showing the coords the preview is centered on when the server has disabled coordinate viewing
- Adjust *Temperature* visualizer range to be -20 to 30 Â°C to better reflect the temperature ranges available in default TFC
