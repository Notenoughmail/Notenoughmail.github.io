# 1.20.1

- [Features](#features)
- [Config](#config)
- [Demo](#demo)

## Features

In the "More" tab of the create world screen there is a new button, "Preview World", which opens the preview screen. This screen has the same options as TFC's world customization screen (plus some additional options) to left, the world preview in the middle, and some information about the preview to the right.

### Options

Has all of TFC's options

- Flat bedrock
- Spawn distance
- Spawn center x/z
- Temperature/rainfall scale
- Temperature/rainfall constant
- Continentalness
- Grass density

In addition there are options to set the x and z offset of the preview, centered on (0,0) by default, the visualizer type, spawn overlay toggle, and a seed field

- Visualizer Type: Determines what the preview will show, defaults to "Rivers and Mountains", clicking will toggle through: "Biomes", "Rainfall", "Temperature", "Biome Altitude", "Inland Height", "Rocks", and back to "Rivers and Mountains"
    - Biomes: Colors the preview based on the biome that was sampled at that point, see [here](https://github.com/Notenoughmail/TFCGenViewer/blob/main/src/main/java/com/notenoughmail/tfcgenviewer/util/ImageBuilder.java#L94-L116) and [here](https://github.com/Notenoughmail/TFCGenViewer/blob/main/src/main/java/com/notenoughmail/tfcgenviewer/util/ImageBuilder.java#L181-L210) for the colors (ABGR) and what biomes they map to
    - Rainfall: Overlays the rainfall onto the land, purple is 0mm and dark red is 500mm
    - Temperature: Overlays the temperature onto the land, purple is -33°C and dark red is 33°C
    - Biome Altitude: Overlays the general height of biomes onto the land, lighter greens means higher altitudes
    - Inland Height: Overlays an approximation of the distance from the coast.
        - Green: Land; lighter is further from the coast
        - Blue: Ocean; darker is further from the coast
    - Rocks: Displays the rock types that will generate by color, different rocks are indicated by different shades
        - Blue: Oceanic rock types
        - Green: Land rock types
        - Magenta: Uplift rock types
        - Pink/Salmon: Volcanic rock types
    - Rivers and Mountains: The same as Biome Altitude with rivers mountains displayed
        - Light Blue: A river
        - Gray: Tall mountains
        - Orange: Short mountains
- Spawn Overlay: Draws a box on the preview showing where the possible spawn points as determined by the spawn distance and center options

Underneath those options is a button labeled "Apply", this recreates the preview with the current options

### Buttons

At the bottom of the screen there are 3 buttons, "Save", "Cancel", and "Current seed"

- Save: Saves the options and exits to the world creation screen
- Cancel: Discards all changes to options and exits to the world creation screen
- Current seed: Displays the seed being displayed and copies it to the clipboard when clicked

### Side Info

To the right of the preview there is some info about the world, the number of regions generated to create the preview and the dimensions (in km) of the preview, the latter of which can be changed via the [config](#config)

### Technical Info

you may have noticed that the preview is not a block-to-pixel representation of the world being created, in actuality each pixel is one *grid*, the "smallest unit generated by [TFC's] region system" and are equal to 8 chunks or 128 blocks. For more on this, see TFC's [Units class](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft/blob/1.20.x/src/main/java/net/dries007/tfc/world/region/Units.java)

## Config

TFCGenViewer has a single config option, `previewSize`. It is an int in the range [16, 2048] and defaults to 256. It determines the size of the preview in grids (8 chunks / 128 blocks) and requires a restart for changes to take effect.
